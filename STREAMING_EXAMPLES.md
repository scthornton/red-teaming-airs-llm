## Technical Details

**Streaming Implementation:**

The app uses Flask's `stream_with_context()` with OpenAI-compatible SSE format:

```python
def generate_openai_stream(content, chunk_size=10):
    # Split content into chunks
    words = content.split()
    chunks = [' '.join(words[i:i+chunk_size]) for i in range(0, len(words), chunk_size)]

    for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks):
        delta = {
            "id": chunk_id,
            "object": "chat.completion.chunk",
            "created": int(datetime.now().timestamp()),
            "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
            "choices": [{
                "index": 0,
                "delta": {"content": chunk + " "},
                "finish_reason": None
            }]
        }
        yield f"data: {json.dumps(delta)}\\n\\n"
        time.sleep(0.05)  # Simulate streaming delay

    # Final chunk
    yield f"data: {json.dumps(final)}\\n\\n"
    yield "data: [DONE]\\n\\n"
```

**Headers:**
```python
headers = {
    'Cache-Control': 'no-cache',
    'X-Accel-Buffering': 'no'
}
```

## Conclusion

**Streaming works flawlessly from GCP VM deployment.**

All streaming requests complete successfully with HTTP 200, content is delivered in chunks via SSE, and Runtime Security successfully scans and blocks malicious content while allowing benign requests through.

The GCP VM approach provides a reliable, production-ready method for testing AI Runtime Security with Red Teaming when Cloud Run authentication restrictions prevent direct access.
